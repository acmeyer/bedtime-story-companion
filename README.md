# Bedtime Story Companion

This repository is for a little experimental application that acts as a bedtime story companion. It uses OpenAI's GPT and DALLE APIs to generate story suggestions and images based on the story you're telling.

The other fun thing about this repository is that much of the code for it was generated by GPT-4 through ChatGPT.

## How to use

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies
3. Run `python app.py`
4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`

## Limitations

- Because it only sends an API request every so often and that request takes time to return results, things can get a little out of sync. 
- It makes a decent amount of API calls as designed right now. This could add up quickly for longer stories.
- The image generation isn't great, wish MidJourney had an API, think that would make for much better images. You could also mess around with the image generation approach to try and get better results.
